# About Erlang
## High availability
- Fault-tolerance
- Scalability
- Distribution
- Responsiveness
- Live update

## Erlang concurrency
## Server-side systems
**Table 1.1   Comparison of technologies used in two real-life web servers**

Technical requirement|Server A|Server B
----|----|----
HTTP server| Nginx and Phusion Passenger |Erlang
Request processing |Ruby on Rails |Erlang
Long-running requests |Go |Erlang
Server-wide state |Redis |Erlang
Persistable data |Redis and MongoDB |Erlang
Background jobs |Cron, Bash scripts, and Ruby |Erlang
Service crash recovery |Upstart |Erlang

## The development platform
The standard part of the release is a framework called Open Telecom Platform
(OTP). Despite its somewhat unfortunate name, the framework has nothing to do with
telecom systems. Itâ€™s a general-purpose framework that abstracts away many typical
Erlang tasks:
- Concurrency and distribution patterns
- Error detection and recovery in concurrent systems
- Packaging code into libraries
- Systems deployment
- Live code updates

# Abount Elixir
Elixir is an alternative language for the Erlang virtual machine that allows you to write
cleaner, more compact code that does a better job of revealing your intentions. You
write programs in Elixir and run them normally in BEAM.

## Code simplification
## Composing functions
## The big picture

# Disadvantages
## Speed
